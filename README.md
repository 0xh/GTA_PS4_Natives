# GTA_PS4_Natives

This is an edit/updated version of Kurt2467's GTA5 PS3 Native Invoker (https://github.com/kurt2467/GTAV_Native_Invoker)

## Requirements
1. 1.76 PS4

## How to use
1. Send the included *loader* payload (loader/loader.bin) to your PS4, you should then get a notification
2. Build your payload
3. Rename to plugin1.bin
4. Copy to USB
5. Plug USB into right USB port on the PS4 (usb0)
6. Start game and you should get a message saying payload was loaded

## Bugs
1. Sometimes the loader payload will crash, I will fix this if enough people complain about it
